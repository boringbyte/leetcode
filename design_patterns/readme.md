## SOLID Principles of Object-oriented Design

- S - Single Responsibility:
  - A class should have only one responsibility.
- O - Open-closed:
  - A class should be open for extension usually by inheritance, but closed for modification.
- L - Liskov substitution:
  - Subclasses should be stand in for their parents without breaking anything.
- I - Interface segregation:
  - A specific interfaces are better than having one do-all interface.
- D - Dependency inversion:
  - We should program towards abstraction, but not implementations. Implementations can vary but not abstractions.


## Main Classification of Design Patterns
- Creational Patterns:
  - Factory Method
    - Defines interface for creating an object
    - Lets subclasses decide which object
    - Defers instantiation of subclasses
    - Also known as Virtual Constructor
    - If we are using if else for creating classes, then we can replace that with this pattern.
  - Abstract Factory
    - Useful for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes
    - Close cousin of Factory pattern
    - Factory creates one product
    - Abstract Factory creates families of products
    - Defers creation of objects to concrete subclasses
    - Also known as Kit pattern
    - Remember matrix of classes ((GM, Ford) * (Economy, Sport, Luxury))
  - Builder
    - As a creational pattern it is useful for creating objects.
    - Separates construction of complex objects from its representation.
    - Builder does this by encapsulating the construction of the object, object the principle encapsulate what varies.
    - Allows multistep construction process
    - Implementations can vary over a period of time and builder can accommodate such changes
    - Client only sees the abstraction
    - Useful if there are too many arguments in the __init__ method
  - Prototype
    - This pattern provide alternative to abstract factory pattern and can also be used in conjunction with it.
    - It uses a given instance as a prototype
    - Creates a clone of the prototype
    - Clone can have different attributes
    - Reduce number of classes since we don't class of every variation.
    - It has one prototype interface with clone method
    - There are concrete prototypes which return a copy of itself.
  - Singleton
    - Don't create more than 1 instance for a class
    - Ensure a class has only one instance
    - Singleton provide a global point of access
    - Class responsible for its one instance
- Structural Patterns:
  - Adapter
    - This pattern is used to make one API look like another one that has different methods and signatures.
    - Similar to power adapters used when traveling from one country to another country.
    - Don't repeat yourself (DRY) principle
    - Converts interface of a class into another that clients expect.
    - There are two types of adapters:
      - Object adapters: Composition
      - Class adapters: Inheritance
    - Favor composition over inheritance
  - Bridge
    - -
  - Composite
    - Part of a tree is mini tree. Also called as part-whole hierarchies.
    - A part resembles the whole tree. Composite pattern handles hierarchies.
    - Uniform code for the whole or the part of the tree.
    - Compose objects into tree structures
    - Represent part-whole hierarchies
    - Clients can handle individual objects and collections of objects using the same code
  - Decorator
  - Facade
  - Flyweight
  - Proxy
- Behavioral Patterns:
  - Strategy
  - Command
  - State
  - Observer
  - Visitor
  - Chain of Responsibility
  - Mediator
  - Memento
  - Null
  - Template
  - Interpreter
