## What is Flyweight Pattern?

**Flyweight Pattern** is a structural design pattern that lets you fit more objects into available RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.

### Key Characteristics:
- ✅ Shares common data to save memory
- ✅ Separates intrinsic state (shared) from extrinsic state (unique)
- ✅ Uses factory to manage shared objects
- ✅ Reduces memory footprint dramatically
- ✅ Ideal for large numbers of similar objects

### The Problem Flyweight Solves

**Without Flyweight:**
```python
# Creating 1 million tree objects
trees = []
for i in range(1_000_000):
    tree = Tree(
        name="Oak",           # Repeated 1M times!
        color="Green",        # Repeated 1M times!
        texture="bark.png",   # Repeated 1M times!
        x=random.randint(0, 1000),
        y=random.randint(0, 1000)
    )
    trees.append(tree)

# Memory: ~1 million × (name + color + texture + x + y) = HUGE!
```

**With Flyweight:**
```python
# Share common data (intrinsic state)
oak_type = TreeType("Oak", "Green", "bark.png")  # Created ONCE

# Store only unique data (extrinsic state)
trees = []
for i in range(1_000_000):
    tree = Tree(
        tree_type=oak_type,  # Reference to shared object
        x=random.randint(0, 1000),
        y=random.randint(0, 1000)
    )
    trees.append(tree)

# Memory: 1 TreeType + 1M × (reference + x + y) = Much smaller!
```

### Real-World Analogy:
Think of a **library**:
- **Without Flyweight:** Every person who wants to read "Harry Potter" gets their own physical copy → Need 1000 copies for 1000 readers
- **With Flyweight:** One shared copy of "Harry Potter" (intrinsic state), readers just keep track of which page they're on (extrinsic state) → Need only 1 copy

### Visual Representation:
```
Without Flyweight:
Object1: [Shared Data A] [Unique Data 1]
Object2: [Shared Data A] [Unique Data 2]  ← Duplicate shared data!
Object3: [Shared Data A] [Unique Data 3]  ← Duplicate shared data!

With Flyweight:
Object1: [→ Flyweight A] [Unique Data 1]
Object2: [→ Flyweight A] [Unique Data 2]  ← Points to same Flyweight!
Object3: [→ Flyweight A] [Unique Data 3]  ← Points to same Flyweight!

Flyweight A: [Shared Data A]  ← Stored only once!
```

## Intrinsic vs Extrinsic State

**Critical Concept:**

| State Type | Description | Example | Stored Where |
|------------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| **Intrinsic** | Shared, immutable, context-independent | Tree species, color, texture | Inside Flyweight (shared) |
| **Extrinsic** | Unique, context-dependent | Tree position (x, y), size | Outside Flyweight (per object) |

**Key Rule:** Flyweight stores **only intrinsic state**. Extrinsic state is passed as parameters or stored separately.

---

## When to Use

### ✅ Perfect Use Cases:

#### 1. **Large Number of Similar Objects**
- Game with thousands of trees, particles, bullets
- Text editor with millions of character objects
- Map with thousands of similar buildings

#### 2. **Objects Share Common Data**
- Most of the data is the same across instances
- Small portion is unique per instance
- Memory consumption is a concern

#### 3. **Object Identity Doesn't Matter**
- Don't need to distinguish individual objects
- Can share objects transparently
- Objects are mostly immutable

#### 4. **Memory is Limited**
- Mobile apps
- Embedded systems
- Games with memory constraints

#### 5. **Creating Objects is Expensive**
- Loading textures, sprites
- Database connections
- Complex initialization

---

## When NOT to Use

### ❌ Avoid Flyweight When:

1. **Few Objects**
   - Only dozens or hundreds of objects
   - Memory saved is negligible
   - Adds unnecessary complexity

2. **Objects Are All Unique**
   - Little to no shared state
   - Most data is extrinsic
   - No memory benefit

3. **Object Identity Matters**
   - Need to track individual objects
   - Objects are mutable
   - Can't share instances

4. **Simple Problem**
   - Memory isn't a concern
   - Premature optimization
   - YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

## Basic Implementation

### Classic Flyweight Structure

```python
from typing import Dict

# ============ FLYWEIGHT ============

        for key in self._flyweights.keys():
            print(f"  - {key}")

# ============ CONTEXT ============

class Context:
    """
    Context stores extrinsic state (unique to each object).
    Contains reference to flyweight (intrinsic state).
    """
    
    def __init__(self, shared_state: str, unique_state: str, factory: FlyweightFactory):
        # Get shared flyweight from factory
        self._flyweight = factory.get_flyweight(shared_state)
        # Store unique state
        self._unique_state = unique_state
    
    def operation(self):
        """Operation delegates to flyweight, passing unique state"""
        self._flyweight.operation(self._unique_state)

# ============ CLIENT CODE ============

print("="*70)
print("BASIC FLYWEIGHT PATTERN")
print("="*70)

factory = FlyweightFactory()

# Create objects with shared state
print("\n### Creating Objects ###")
context1 = Context("SharedType-A", "Unique-1", factory)

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Pitfall 1: Making Flyweight Mutable

```python
# BAD - Mutable flyweight breaks sharing!
class BadFlyweight:
    def __init__(self, shared_data):
        self.shared_data = shared_data
        self.counter = 0  # Mutable state!
    
    def increment(self):
        self.counter += 1  # Affects all objects sharing this flyweight!

# GOOD - Immutable flyweight
class GoodFlyweight:
    def __init__(self, shared_data):
        self._shared_data = shared_data  # Immutable
    
    def operation(self, unique_state):
        # Operate using unique_state parameter
        pass
```

---

### ❌ Pitfall 2: Storing Extrinsic State in Flyweight

```python
# BAD - Position is extrinsic, shouldn't be in flyweight!
class BadTree:
    def __init__(self, species, color, x, y):
        self.species = species  # Intrinsic
        self.color = color      # Intrinsic
        self.x = x             # Extrinsic - Wrong!
        self.y = y             # Extrinsic - Wrong!

# GOOD - Separate intrinsic and extrinsic
class TreeType:  # Flyweight
    def __init__(self, species, color):
        self.species = species  # Intrinsic only
        self.color = color

class Tree:  # Context
    def __init__(self, x, y, tree_type):
        self.x = x  # Extrinsic
        self.y = y
        self._type = tree_type  # Reference to flyweight
```

---

### ❌ Pitfall 3: Not Using Factory

```python
# BAD - Creating flyweights directly (no sharing!)
tree_type1 = TreeType("Oak", "Green")
tree_type2 = TreeType("Oak", "Green")  # Duplicate!
# These are different objects even though identical

# GOOD - Factory ensures sharing
factory = TreeTypeFactory()
tree_type1 = factory.get_tree_type("Oak", "Green")
tree_type2 = factory.get_tree_type("Oak", "Green")
# Same object, properly shared
```

---

### ❌ Pitfall 4: Using Flyweight for Few Objects

```python
# BAD - Only 5 objects, no benefit
for i in range(5):
    obj = factory.get_flyweight(shared_data)
# Overhead > benefit

# GOOD - Use flyweight for many objects
for i in range(10000):
    obj = factory.get_flyweight(shared_data)
# Significant memory savings
```

---

## Best Practices

### ✅ 1. Clearly Identify Intrinsic vs Extrinsic State

```python
# Document what's shared and what's unique
class TreeType:  # FLYWEIGHT
    """
    Intrinsic state (shared):
    - species name
    - color
    - texture
    """
    pass

class Tree:  # CONTEXT
    """
    Extrinsic state (unique):
    - x position
    - y position
    - age
    """
    pass
```

---

### ✅ 2. Make Flyweights Immutable

```python
class ImmutableFlyweight:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self._data = data  # Private, no setter
    
    @property
    def data(self):
        return self._data  # Read-only
```

---

### ✅ 3. Use Factory for All Flyweight Creation

```python
# Don't create flyweights directly
# flyweight = Flyweight(data)  ❌

# Always use factory
flyweight = factory.get_flyweight(data)  ✅
```

---

### ✅ 4. Consider Thread Safety

```python
import threading

class ThreadSafeFlyweightFactory:
    def __init__(self):
        self._flyweights = {}
        self._lock = threading.Lock()
    
    def get_flyweight(self, key):
        with self._lock:
            if key not in self._flyweights:
                self._flyweights[key] = Flyweight(key)
            return self._flyweights[key]
```

---

### ✅ 5. Measure Memory Savings

```python
class FlyweightFactory:
    def get_memory_savings(self):
        """Calculate and report memory savings"""
        objects_created = self._total_requests
        flyweights_cached = len(self._flyweights)
        
        without = objects_created * OBJECT_SIZE
        with_flyweight = flyweights_cached * OBJECT_SIZE
        saved = without - with_flyweight
        
        return f"Saved {saved} bytes ({saved/without*100:.1f}%)"
```

---

## Summary

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Purpose** | Share common data to save memory |
| **Use When** | Many similar objects, limited memory |
| **Avoid When** | Few objects, mostly unique data |
| **Key Concept** | Separate intrinsic (shared) from extrinsic (unique) state |
| **Structure** | Flyweight (shared) + Context (unique) + Factory (manages) |

---

## Flyweight Pattern Checklist

✅ **Use Flyweight when:**
- Creating thousands/millions of similar objects
- Objects share significant common data
- Memory is limited or expensive
- Most object state can be made extrinsic
- Object identity doesn't matter (can share)

❌ **Don't use Flyweight when:**
- Few objects (< 100)
- Objects are mostly unique
- Memory isn't a concern
- Need mutable shared state
- Premature optimization

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Memory Efficiency:** Dramatically reduces memory by sharing common data

2. **Intrinsic vs Extrinsic:** Separate what's shared (intrinsic) from what's unique (extrinsic)

3. **Immutability:** Flyweights must be immutable to be safely shared

4. **Factory Pattern:** Always use factory to manage flyweight sharing

5. **Trade-off:** Saves memory but adds complexity and some CPU overhead

6. **Use Cases:** Games (particles, sprites), text editors (characters), UI (widgets)

---

## Memory Savings Example

```python
# Without Flyweight: 1,000,000 trees
# Each tree: 100 bytes (name, color, texture, x, y)
# Total: 100 MB

# With Flyweight: 1,000,000 trees
# 3 tree types: 3 × 100 bytes = 300 bytes
# 1M positions: 1M × 20 bytes = 20 MB
# Total: ~20 MB

# Savings: 80 MB (80% reduction!)
```
